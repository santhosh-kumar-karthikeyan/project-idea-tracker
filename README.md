# Project idea tracker
Whether or not anyone else benefits from this project, I'm pretty sure I'll gain the most from it. I say this because the use case I’m presenting here has been handled in the most inefficient way possible. I’m talking about tracking project ideas and their statuses. And the method I used to do that — believe it or not — was through WhatsApp messages to myself. Since I was learning React and all, I figured, why not develop a web app for it? And here I am.
